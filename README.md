 JSON Input and Output - I just made a new exercise in order to
 study and learn how to manipulate JSON files. I'm finding this
 a bit hard, but I must not quit, since I need to know JSON to
 improve many features in another projects. Now, my main challenge
 is to discover how to use tree style (nodes) using Jackson API for
 JSON. Somehow my nodes are not being read by GSON and I don't know
 how to do it.

 Edit substring in a File - In order to improve my Post-Installation Tool
 I needed to implement a way to change only parts of specific strings
 in the corefile. So I created this little patch of code. "EditFileApache"
 is just an alternative version using Apache Commons libraries.
 "TestProcessOpen" and "TestProcessOpen2" - two ways of check if specific
 process is running in memory. The second can return output to console.
